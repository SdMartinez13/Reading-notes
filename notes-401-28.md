# Component Lifecycle/Hook

## Readings

[effects hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

- What purpose does useEffect serve in a function component compared to its counterpart(s) in class components?

  - you can think of `useEffect` Hook as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined

- When using the useEffect Hook:
  - What does useEffect do?

    - By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative AP

  - Why is useEffect called inside a component?

    - Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect. We don’t need a special API to read it — it’s already in the function scope. Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.

- Explain the importance of properly implementing effects with Cleanup

  - cleanup is necessary to prevent memory leaks

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/)?

- I want to really understand the API process
