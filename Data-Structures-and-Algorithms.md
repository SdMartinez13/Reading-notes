## Discussion Questions

***

***What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?***

* get a good understanding of data structures and use that knowledge for the best use for your project.

***How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?***

* reduce the number of function calls, limit the number of variables that are created

## Things I want to know more about

* Great info through the videos, but I'd like to see the live instruction and how it applies to our labs to get a better understanding.
