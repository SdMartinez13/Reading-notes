## Reflection

- I read "The code I'm still ashamed of" and I found it very powerful.  The author states, "There are a million and one ways for me to rationalize my part in later suicides and severe depression. Even today, there is ongoing litigation with former patients.

- It’s easy to make an argument that I had no part in it at all. Still, I’ve never felt okay about writing that code." I see how he would feel that way even after all these years.  He was young and doing the job given to him.  He wasn't a doctor.  He didn't know anything about the drug.  He found a discrepancy in the quiz he built, but again, he did his job as a developer.  Once he found out about the issues with the drug, he resigned, and I think ethically thats what he needed to do, for himself.  I could definitely see why he's feels the way he does to this day, But I feel he did the right thing. What I get out of this is that if I feel there is something wrong while writing code, speak up immediately.  Him speaking up at the time about the quiz wouldn't changed anything as a result of patients taking the drug.

- I also read 'Amazon workers demand Jeff Bezos cancel “Recognition” software'.  Without getting political, there have been so many benefits to facial recognition software.  I have personally seen the software in use and I believe it has had potential to save lives.  I work in a school district and the use of recognition software has been in use for almost 2 years.  The software can detect weapons and also has facial recognition capabilities.  I personally believe that having that extra security that will keep our youth safe and I believe it's needed.  I have children in school and if there is something that will help identify, deter, and possibly prevent serious injury and death, I feel it belongs in out society.
