# Application State with Redux

## Reading

[Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

- What is the first principle of Redux?

  - start with creating a singleton for storage

- what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?

  - The Redux store brings together the state, actions, and reducers that make up your app

- Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.

  - `reducer` (Function): A reducing function that returns the next state tree, given the current state tree and an action to handle.

- `[preloadedState]` (any): The initial state. You may optionally specify it to hydrate the state from the server in universal apps, or to restore a previously serialized user session. If you produced `reducer` with `combineReducers`, this must be a plain object with the same shape as the keys passed to it. Otherwise, you are free to pass anything that your `reducer` can understand.

- `[enhancer]` (Function): The store enhancer. You may optionally specify it to enhance the store with third-party capabilities such as middleware, time travel, persistence, etc. The only store enhancer that ships with Redux is `applyMiddleware()`.

- Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.

  - As your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.
