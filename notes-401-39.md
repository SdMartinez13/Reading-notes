# Redux - Additional Topics

## Reading

[Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

- What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?

  - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
  - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
  - "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

- What does configureStore() do?

  - wraps `createStore` to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes `redux-thunk` by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

- How would I use createSlice()?

  - accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.

[MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)

- What is Mobx?

  - is a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution

- How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?

  - data needs to be normalized, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like classes in case you fancy those

- How would we build a reactive user interface?

  - By using an observer pattern
