## Readings

[An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

    * *basically a translator between operating systems and apps*

2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.

    * *node web framework*

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

    * *make it easier for developers to use the most suitable tools to complete a particular task*

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

    * *JS file, and it can help keep your code organzied and managable, not all your code on one file*

[What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

    * *8.19.1*

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

    * *npm install jshint*

[What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

    * *you want to test you hard work before you can say it comeplete, it's like that*

2. What are three expected benefits of testing

    * *significant reductions in defect rates at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort, these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases, TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code*

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

    * *forgetting to run tests frequently/writing too many tests at once, partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD/poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time*

[CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

    * *ensures the teams changes will intergrate, catches bugs, reduces merge conflicts*

2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

    * *Delivery is the practice of developing software in such a way that it could be released at any time/deployment is an extension of CI that allows you to deploy changes in real time*

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

    * working in a team github will help orgaize your project and you can see changes in realtime

## Things I want to know more about

* I get the concept of TDD and CI/CD but it's always nice to see it work in real world applications.
