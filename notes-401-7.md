      * a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object

  2. When should we use JSON Web Tokens?

      * used for authorization and information exchange

  3. Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?

      * The second part of the token is the `payload`, which contains the claims

* [Are JWTs Secure?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27301557/if-you-can-decode-jwt-how-are-they-secure)

  1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?
