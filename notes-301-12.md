***In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:***

* 100’s = informational statatus code that tells the client the header part of the reqest has been received.


* 200’s = success codes


* 300’s = redirection codes


* 400’s = client error codes, something is wrong on the client end


* 500’s = server error code, back end issues


* What is a status code 202?

    * Accepted, asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future


* What is a status code 308?

    * Permanent Redirect - This is the right code if the resource will now be available at a new URL and the client should directly access it via the new URL in the future


* What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

    * 204


* What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

    * 410 gone
