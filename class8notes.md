# Operators and Loops

**Assignment operators**

- *An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal `(=)`, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, `x = f()` is an assignment expression that assigns the value of `f()` to `x`*

**Asigning to Properties**

- *If a variable refers to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that variable*

**Destructing**

- *For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals*

**Evaluation and nesting**

- *In general, assignments are used within a variable declaration (i.e., with `const`, `let`, or `var`) or as standalone statements)*

- *like other expressions, assignment expressions like `x = f()` evaluate into a result value. Although this result value is usually not used, it can then be used by another expression*

- *By chaining or nesting an assignment expression, its result can itself be assigned to another variable. It can be logged, it can be put inside an array literal or function call, and so on*

**Comparison operators**

- *A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or `object` values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the `===` and `!==` operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons. These operators do not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before checking equality*
