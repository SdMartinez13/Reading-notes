### [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

* A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text

* The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands

* Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - )

* (for me) If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.

* shell-part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you

* bash- most common shell which stands for, 'Bourne Again Shell'

* Shortcuts-entered commands are stored in your history.  using the up and down keys you can select from your history, you can also edit by using the left/right keys to move the cursor.
