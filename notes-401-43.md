# Class 43: Gatsby, next.js, and other JS Frameworks

## Gatsby and next.js Resources

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)

- [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)

- [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)

- [Gatsby.js Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

- Look over the above content.
  - Teach us two things about Next.js.

    - `Automatic code splitting`-Next.js is clever enough to only load the Javascript and CSS that are needed for any given page. This makes for much faster page loading times, as a userâ€™s browser doesn't have to download Javascript and CSS that it doesn't need for the specific page the user is viewing.
    - `Hot Module Replacement (HMR)`-HMR allows developers to see any changes they have made during development, live in the application as soon as they have been made. However, unlike traditional "live reload" methods, it only reloads the modules that have actually changed, preserving the state the application was in and significantly reducing the amount of time required to see changes in action.


  - Teach us two things about Gatsby.js.

    - `Static Site Generator (SSG)`-The Gatsby SSG is a more flexible option than traditional database-driven content management systems such as Wordpress or Drupal. Gatsby loads JSON from GraphQL, merges data and creates an HTML page that is deployed to the server as static files. This reduces the latency that sites run by databases experience.
    - `Deferred Static Generator (DSG)`-Gatsby allows sites to defer non-critical page generation to increase load times. This allows developers to generate only the most important pages during a build. Less trafficked pages are then rendered only when accessed by site users. This is especially useful for large and complex sites.
