# Context API-Behaviors

## Readings

[Hooks and Context example](https://medium.com/swlh/snackbars-in-react-an-exercise-in-hooks-and-context-299b43fd2a2b)

- With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do?

  - The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants. Since any React component in a React Redux app can be connected to the store, most applications will render a `<Provider>` at the top level, with the entire app's component tree inside of it.

- With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role?

  - All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Provider’s value prop changes. The propagation from Provider to its descendant consumers (including `.contextType` and `useContext`) is not subject to the `shouldComponentUpdate` method, so the consumer is updated even when an ancestor component skips an update.

- Specifically with Context, how are we “wrapping” components to achieve our goals?

  - The wrapped component receives all the props of the container, along with a new prop, data , which it uses to render its output.
