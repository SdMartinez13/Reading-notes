# Advanced State with Reducers

## Readings

[useReducer hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

- Name an alternative to the `useState` Hook.

  - `useReducer`

- Why might the `useReducer` Hook be preferable to the `useState` Hook?

  - helps you manage complex state logic in React applications

- What are two ways to set the initial state?

  - pass the initial state as a second argument/pass an init function as a third argument

[Ultimate Guide to useReducer](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-to-react-usereducer-hook/)

- In terms of state, what does `useReducer` expect to receive as a parameter?

  - reducer function as the first and the initial state as the second

- What does `useReducer` return?

  - returns an array that holds the current state value and a `dispatch` function to which you can pass an action and later invoke it

- Explain `dispatch` to a non-technical recruiter.

  - basically it sends the type of action to the reducer function, which updates state

## Reflection

- What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/)?
  - I'm looking forward to the lecture tomorrow on how the reducer function works in the code we're working on
