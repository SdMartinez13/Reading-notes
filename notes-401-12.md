# Socket.io

## Readings

* [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

  * What is a Web Socket?

    * is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection

  * Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.

    * the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol

  * Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

    * request

* [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

  * What does the event handler `io.on()` do?

    * handles connection, disconnection, etc., events in it, using the socket object.

  * Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected

    * server side-The best way to see what information is available is to use the `*` Client side-`localStorage.debug = '*';` in console

  * What does `socket.emit()` do?

    * This allows you to emit functions

* [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

  * What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

    * WebSocket establishes http connections while Socket.IO is the library to handle WebSocket

  * When would you use Socket.IO?

    * I handle all the degradation of your technical alternatives to get full-duplex communication in real-time.
    * It also handles the various support level and the inconsistencies from the browser.
    * It also gives the additional feature room support for basic publish infrastructure and thinks like automatic reconnect.
    * Currently, AFAIK is the most used one and easier to help with vanilla web sockets.

  * When would you use WebSockets?

    * It provides full-duplex communication, which helps in persisting the connection established between the Client and the Web Server.
    * It also lives up to the standards and provides the accuracy and efficiency stream events to and from with negligible latency.
    * WebSocket removes the overhead and reduce complexity.
    * It makes real-time communication effortless and efficient.
