# Readings: Functional programming

## Reading

**[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)**

* ***What is functional programming?***

  * a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

* ***What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?***

  * It returns the same result if given the same arguments, It does not cause any observable side effects

* ***What are the benefits of a pure function?***

  * easier to test, no need to mock?, 

* ***What is immutability?***

  * unchanging over time, or unable to be changed

* ***What is Referential transparency?***

  * f a function consistently yields the same result for the same input


## Videos 

**[Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)**

* ***What is a module?***

  * js libraries/file

* ***What does the word ‘require’ do?***

  * includes a module using the same name

* ***How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?***

  * require(./`'file-name'`);

* ***What do we have to do to make a module available?***

  * module.exports = `'file-name'`

## Things I want to know more about:
 * when do we use functional programming, are we already using it?
