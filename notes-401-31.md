# Context API

## Readings

[Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

* What can React Context provide your app?

  * Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

* Why might we use Context?

  * Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels

* Why should we use it sparingly?

  * because it makes component reuse more difficult

 Consume content from (at least) two of the Awesome React Context links. Share your take-away from each:

* Takeaway 1:

  * [Use the new Context API](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-use-the-new-react-context-api) Although there are some parts to that video I didn't understand I got that using context allows you to pull props without digging all the way down to get to it.  Sounded a lot better in the video but typing it out doesn't sound as easy

* Takeaway 2:

  * [Here's how React's New API works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLJN4JfniH4) So watching him code it all out on one page without having to export it made a lot more sense.  I look forward to this week

## Additional Questions

* Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-7), What do you look forward to learning?

  * after watching videos on context API I really look forward to learning and implementing that this week

* What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/)?

  * My goals remain the same and I want to be proficient in what we're learning and prepare myself for the whiteboard interview
