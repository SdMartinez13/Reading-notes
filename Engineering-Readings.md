## Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

   * I believe everyone is given the same information and instruction, at least going through this course.  It's about how well you understand it and can show what you've learned in the workforce.  I think MY drive and motivation will help me stand out in this career.  

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

   * My biggest thing I've learned while going to school and learning something new is, TAKE BREAKS!  I've had many times where I walk away from the computer and recharge myself and come back with a clear head.  Also, Read and re-read instructions, notes, or examples.  I've had to go over assignments, notes and examples many times to make sure I have a good understanding of what I'm trying to accomplish.  Finally for me, Google has been my friend. There are so many resources on the internet and 10/10 someone else had asked the question you are asking.  Side note, NETWORKING has been a great resouce for me as well.
