# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Reading

[async actions](https://redux.js.org/advanced/asyncactions)

1. Why use Redux middleware?

- Redux Middleware allows you to intercept every action sent to the reducer so you can make changes to the action or cancel the action. Middleware helps you with logging, error reporting, making asynchronous requests, and a whole lot more

2. Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.

- also allows for middleware that sits between an action being dispatched and the action reaching the reducers

3. How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?

- middlewares that wrap all the logic into functions instead, which mimic the natural behavior of the store

[thunk middleware](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

1. Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?

- Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows for delayed actions, including working with promises

2. Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.

- function

3. Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.

- Any return value from the inner function will be available as the return value of dispatch itself.

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-38/)

- just want to focus on whiteboards coming up
